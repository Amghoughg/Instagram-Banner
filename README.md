# Instagram Banner
Instagram users like to create a banner of their photos on their profile mainly for promotional content. This app helps users to pick a photo from their photo library or click a new picture and break it up into a grid of photos that can be uploaded to Instagram in correct order to create the banner.</br></br>

The photo can be arranged in grid of 9, 6 or 3 and adjusted by scrolling through or rotation.</br></br>
